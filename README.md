**GDI - GeoDigitalToolkit**

*A Common Toolkit for Data Handling*
___

All digital geoscience data requires extremely diverse ETL processes. While the extraction and transformation processes require highly bespoke solutions (cygnets), the loading of data is often performed with general-purpose tools. 

This library is designed to facilitate the loading of tabular data from various projects. The goal is to centralise the data handling tools and logging, to facilitate loading datasets into a single structured database. 

This system is intended purely for internal usage by GSWA personnel, for loading the outputs of the various tabular outputs.
