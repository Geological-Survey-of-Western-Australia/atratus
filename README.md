<p style="text-align: center;font-size:1.5em"> A Common Toolkit for Data Handling</p>

---

This library is designed to facilitate the loading of data from cygnets to the future GeoDigital database. The goal is to centralise the data handling tools across multiple cygnets which share a common task, loading datasets into a single structured database. 

All digital geoscience data requires extremely diverse ETL processes. While the extraction and transformation require highly bespoke solutions (cygnets). The loading of elements is highly similar and ultimately handled by this library. 

This system is intended purely for internal usage by GSWA personel, for loading the outputs of the various cygnets to a centralised database. 

Presently it's features include:
 - Nothing
