All digital geoscience data requires extremely diverse ETL processes. While the extraction and transformation require highly bespoke solutions (cygnets). The loading of elements is often highly similar, with the goal of loggign . 

This library is designed to facilitate the loading of tabular data from our various projects. The goal is to centralise the data handling tools and logging, to facilitate loading datasets into a single structured database. 

This system is intended purely for internal usage by GSWA personel, for loading the outputs of the various tabular outputs.
