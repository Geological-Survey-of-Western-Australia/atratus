Core Workflow
=============================================

Overview
----------------------

Most geodata harmonisation efforts can best be described as a process, comprised as a series of steps, iterating over a large number of inputs. Each of these steps can encounter errors or issues that will need to be addressed by either:

 - Geoscientist - *Reviews the Data*
 - Developer - *Reviews the Code*

This process of data harmonisation has distinct input requirements for each step. Such that if depending steps fail then subsequent steps can't be run.
